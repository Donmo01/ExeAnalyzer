Inc. that allowed users to communicate in real-time through text, voice, and video chat. Typically found in the installation directory C:\Program Files\Yahoo!\Messenger, this file is legitimate and part of the software package, meaning it is generally safe to use; however, users should be cautious as malware can sometimes masquerade under the same name. There have been reports of errors related to yahoomessenger.exe, often stemming from corrupted installations or compatibility issues with newer operating systems, but these can usually be resolved through reinstallation or updates.
